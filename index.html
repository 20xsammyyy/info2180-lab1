        <p>Hii, I'm currently majoring in Computer Science.I love listening to music. Currently, my favourite artists are Don Toliver, LUCKI, Smino and Jungle. I also like watching youtube gamers and ASMR eating vids. I decided to do this course because i wanted to learn additional information about website development and potentially sharpen my skills for the future.</p>
